# Firebase React Proof-of-Concept
This is an example of how to integrate [FirebaseUI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web-react) with [react-redux-firebase](https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase). Note that the code to write user profile data to Firebase is done outside of react-redux-firebase because currently it is unreachable from within it. My goal was to make sure that the code to write to Firebase and the code to dispatch the profile to the redux store closely adhered to how react-redux-firebase does it.
